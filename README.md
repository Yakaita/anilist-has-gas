### What is this?

This is the source code to my library for connecting to Anilist's API for use in spreadsheets or what have you complete with autocomplete and JSDocs. **This is not associated with Anilist. It is just something I made to make it easier to connect with for my spreadsheets!**

### How do I use this?

I mean technically you could copy the code and paste it in your own script but if you want to you can go to [this link](https://script.google.com/d/1NEwDrIFvirxszpcqaaH-hE3OlfX8JkNY6fmwNfFt-H_A6ECrgguWB_ch/edit?usp=sharing) to get access.

From there you can take the library id[^library-id] and paste it in the "add a library"[^add-library-button] section on the left side.
Click look up then choose the version you want to use. **Do not use Head! That is the most recent file and is dev only so it will most definitally not work as expected.**
Change the identifier to whatever you want. This is basically what you call so make it easy. 
For example change the identifier to Anilist and that would let you call Anilist.getMedia(1)

And thats it! Now the library is added to your script and you can start to call all the methods when you need to. Watch this repo so you can know when new builds are ready to be switched to.

If you don't understand then go to the [google help page for libraries](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/libraries).

### Do not do merges or PRs because this code is just copy pasted it isnt actually synced with my code on Google App Script

*I am in no means an expert! If you notice something is wrong or can be done better make an issue and I'll check it out.*
